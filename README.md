# ANNs using Pytorch (Regression) â€“ NYC Taxi Fares
## Data:
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked
with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and
dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two
points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an
example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge is to do better than using Machine Learning
techniques!

<ul>
<li>pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the taxi ride started.</li>
<li>pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.</li>
<li>pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.</li>
<li>dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.</li>
<li>dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.</li>
<li>passenger_count - integer indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.</li>
